 * - a vector of sampled unique pixels indices;
 * - a pointer to a labels image, of the same with/height and number of channels of 
 *   stored image, containing the class index to which the associated pixel
 *   belongs to. Labels start from 1 and the 0 value is reserved to represent unlabeled
 *   pixels;
 * - a vector containing the probability distribution of pixels over classes.

 *  \tparam type TrainingSetImage pixels type.
