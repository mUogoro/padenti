 * \brief TrainingSet class.
 * The class is responsible of loading and sampling a set of images pairs stored on disk in
 * a path specified by the user. Each pair consists of a data image, containing pixels values,
 * and a labels image, where pixels labels are stored. The two images are combined in a single
 * TrainingSetImage instance, sampled and stored within the TrainingSet object. Pairs are
 * recognized by their names: data and labels image files have the same prefix and a different
 * suffix specified by the user.
